# Errors

## Absolute and Relative Errors

Relative errors are better suited for physical systems. This is due to the fact that a relative error is dimensionless, that is to say that changing the units of measurement will not change the system's relative error. However a change of units will change the absolute error.

Let $\alpha$ represent the approximated solution and $x$ represent the true solution. 

$$ Error_{\text{relative}} = \lvert\frac{(\alpha - x)}{x} \rvert$$

$$ Error_{\text{absolute}} = \lvert \alpha - x \rvert $$
